# Biography

I am now a third-year Master student in Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, graduating in 2021, advised by Prof. Shu-Tao Xia. Prior to that, I received my Bachelar degree in Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. I was fortunately advised by Dr. Peilin Zhao when I was an intern at Tencent AI Lab. My research interests mainly include **Graph Neural Network**, **Time Series Analysis**, and **Regularization on Neural Networks**.

*I am now looking for PhD opportunities starting in 2021 Fall. If you are interested in me, please contact me: **dqg18 at mails.tsinghua.edu.cn**.*
